ANTsPy is a Python library which wraps the well-established C++ biomedical image processing library [ANTs](https://github.com/ANTsX/ANTs). It includes blazing-fast reading and writing of medical images, algorithms for registration, segmentation, and statistical learning, as well as functions to create publication-ready visualizations.

If you are looking to train deep learning models on your medical images, you might be interested in [ANTsPyNet](https://github.com/ANTsX/ANTsPy) which provides tools for training and visualizing medical imaging-related deep learning models. ANTsPy and ANTsPyNet seamlessly integrate with the greater Python community, particularly deep learning libraries, scikit-learn, and numpy.
