# Unified Documentation for Advanced Normalization Tools

This repository contains docs for the ANTsX ecosystem of packages and the
ants.dev platform, as well as tutorials for medical image analysis featuring
ANTs that are language-agnostic (i.e., include the same code snippets in bash,
R, and Python).

## Style Guide

These docs are hosted on ants.dev/docs. There are a few style considerations
to follow in order to ensure an ideal user experience on ants.dev.

- use two hashmarks (`##`) to denote major headers or sections in articles. This
  is because all two-hashmark headers are displayed in the right sidebar of ants.dev/docs
  to allow users to navigate within articles.

- using R markdown (.Rmd) is OK but they need to be converted to markdown to be useable.
