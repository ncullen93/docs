Welcome to the documentation for architectures on ants.dev

## What are architectures?

This is an example of some code. Try this out to see if it works across multiple lines and whether
or not the syntax highlighting looks as it should look. There is support for most languages, although
if you don't specify a language then it will default to javascript.

```r
x <- mtcars %>% dplyr::filter(hp > 3)
```
